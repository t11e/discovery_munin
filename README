To setup the discovery munin plugin, install munin-node on the box.

Copy discovery_ into /etc/munin/custom/.

Then edit /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node to add a block
for the plugin itself.

[discovery_*]
user discovery
env.DISCOVERY_PATH /var/discovery/engines

Then setup the appropriate symlinks in /etc/munin/plugins.

To see available monitors:

/etc/munin/custom/discovery_ suggest

To see available engines (to help diagnose the path)

env DISCOVERY_PATH="/var/discovery/engines" \
  /etc/munin/custom/discovery_ engines

To make the memory monitor available for the engine on port 8090

cd /etc/munin/plugins && ln -s ../custom/discovery_ discovery_memory_8090

Once you'd changed the symlinks in /etc/munin/plugin, remember to reload the
node with /etc/init.d/munin-node restart.

Sample shell script to symlink a load of engines

cd /etc/munin/plugins
for monitor in $(../custom/discovery_ suggest)
do
  for port in 8096 8097 18082 8812 8098 8080 19091 9086
  do
    ln -s ../custom/discovery_ discovery_${monitor}_${port}
  done
done
